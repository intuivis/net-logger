# Project Overview

## Name
NetControl

## Description
This application is used by Net Control stations to check-in other radio operators when they join and participate in on-air Nets. This application was primarily designed to encourage amateur radio operators to get on the air, join or lead a NET, and for radio stations on Nets to earn badges for their participation and achievements.

## Goals
- Provide Net Control Operators with a clean and modern net logging tool.
- Encourage regular participation with badges and awards.
- Give Net Control Operators a great platform to run their nets and make those that attend the Net feel welcome.

## Constraints
- Restrict the use of Google API Key
- Keep dependencies limited to actively maintained libraries.
